            <h2>Pre-Purchase Inspection Services</h2>
            <p>Now that you've found the right vehicle, you need professionally trained eyes and ears to ensure that the
                seller's description is accurate and that the vehicle is worth buying. Harvey’s Pre-Purchase Inspection
                Service can help those of you who are looking for piece of mind when shopping for a used vehicle.</p>

            <p>We offer two levels of inspections:</p>
            <h4>Level 1 Inspection:</h3>
                <p>The first level is a basic 30 point inspection overview of the vehicle, looking at all of the safety
                    items, fluid levels, checking belts, hoses, lights, brakes, and tires and other items. This level of
                    service takes approximately 30-45 minutes.</p>
                <h4>Level 2 Inspection:</h3>
                    <p>The second level is a more rigorous inspection. This service consists of a complete and thorough
                        inspection of the vehicle's VIN tag, body and frame, all mechanical components, and complete
                        interior
                        appointments. Checking more than 100 different points on the vehicle, this level inspects the
                        entire
                        vehicle to ensure that it's of sound quality and has no hidden damage or any immediately needed
                        repairs.
                        This service includes checking for technical service bulletins and any possible recall notices.
                        You'll
                        also receive an in-depth analysis of the vehicle's core information such as basic quality and
                        soundness,
                        including restorations, upgrades and other customizations. This level of service takes from
                        60-90
                        minutes to complete.</p>
