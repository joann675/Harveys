      <h2>Oil Change Service – Keep your engine clean and running smooth</h1>
        <p>The key to maintaining engine longevity is simple: frequent oil changes. The oil and filter should be
          changed regularly for maximum engine performance according to the recommendations in your owner’s manual
          or by following the “every 3 months or 3000 miles" rule of thumb.</p>
        <p>The role of oil in a car's engine is to protect internal parts and provide lubrication against wear. The
          oil continually circulates throughout the engine and over time it breaks down. During that time the oil
          accumulates substances such as dust, metallic shavings, unburned fuel and even antifreeze that can
          damage
          internal engine parts. </p>
        <p>The oil filter works to trap and remove debris and other contaminants. When the oil filter becomes
          saturated, the oil is no longer "cleaned" and the risks posed by contaminants intensify. Oil pressure
          can
          also suffer once the filter becomes clogged. As a result, fuel economy decreases and the risk of
          emissions
          increases along with the potential for engine failure.</p>
