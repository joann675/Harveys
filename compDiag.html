            <h2>Computer Diagnosis and Check Engine Light Services</h2>
            <p>Today’s vehicles are run by computers. Harvey’s maintains the industry leading computer diagnostic
                equipment to allow our technicians to efficiently and accurately
                diagnose check engine lights. This equipment allows us to communicate directly with any vehicle’s
                computer and quickly get to the root cause of the problem. Unlike other shops, this allows us to save
                you time and money by quickly pinpointing your car’s problem and fixing it the first time.</p>
            <p>Let our expert technicians diagnose and repair any part of your vehicle’s electronic system to ensure
                your vehicle is in top driving condition. Our services include:</p>
            <p><strong>Check Engine Light:</strong> No one likes to see their vehicle's "Check Engine" light come on.The
                light could mean a costly problem, like a bad catalytic converter, or it could be something minor, like
                a loose gas cap. At Harvey’s we can diagnose and repair the problem for you.</p>
            <p><strong>Computer:</strong> Today, vehicle manufacturers include at least one computer in motor vehicles.
                A computer's main function is to monitor and adjust engine and transmission operations. The computer
                receives input information from different sensors. It controls spark plugs, idle speed, and fuel
                injectors so as to get you the best possible performance. Failure of the computer will greatly affect
                the things it controls, so to get the most out of your vehicle's computer, have it evaluated regularly
                for updates and proper operation by Harvey’s.</p>
            <p><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Our technicians are able to diagnose all of the electronic parts in your
                vehicle so for expert diagnostics services, call Harvey’s today.</p>
            <p><strong>Drivability:</strong> Drivability is the degree of smoothness and steadiness of your vehicle's
                acceleration. Most modern vehicles are fitted with on-board computers that continuouslycheck the
                readings from various sensors. In case of drivability problems, you will receive a warning message on
                your vehicle's dashboard. To have your vehicle diagnosed for drivability issues, give Harvey’s a call.
                We have the necessary tools and technology to diagnose and address your vehicle's drivability issues.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Engine Controls:</strong> Basically, an engine control system is an on-board computer in your
                vehicle. Like all computers, the engine controls are composed of hardware and software. Automotive
                engine control systems are responsible for regulating exhaust emissions and providing increased fuel
                economy. To get the best out of your vehicle's incredibly powerful technology, make sure engine controls
                are working properly by calling Harvey’s today.</p>
